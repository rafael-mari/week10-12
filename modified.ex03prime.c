/********************************************************
 * Ex05 -- Prime number *
 * *
 * Author: Rafael Mar√≠. *
 * *
 * Purpose: Compute a program that tells if a number is prime or not. *
 * *
 * Usage: *
 * Run the program, enter number and it appears if it is prime or not. *
 * *
 * Updates *
 * Don't ask the user to enter a number, scan the number from a file and then tell whether it is a prime number or not. *
