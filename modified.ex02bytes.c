/********************************************************
 * Ex03 -- bytes conversion. *
 * *
 * Author: Rafael Mar√≠. *
 * *
 * Purpose: Calculate the time it takes a serial transmission line to send a file if it transmits 960 characters per seconds. *
 * *
 * Usage: *
 * Run the program, enter the size of the file, then the time it takes to transmit it appears. *
 * *
 * Updates *
 * Store the result in a new file *
